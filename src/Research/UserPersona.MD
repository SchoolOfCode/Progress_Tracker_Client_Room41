Research is based on bootcampers direct questions and answers which gave us a clear idea of who they are, so we knew what they want from their tracker.

USER RESEARCH:

8 people including us (team) bootcampers took into consideration all of our wishes to make the product user friendly and useful.
List of Bootcampers who had been interviewed for this Product (outside of our room):

Katherine Tweeddale,
Luna Y,
Scott Brown,
Gabriel Magni

Three out of four interviewed persons said that they would like to keep track of theirs morning quiz progress during their 16 weeks of studying in Bootcamp. Gabriel said he want to see the weekly progress rather just day only progress, which we took into consideration during our planning. Katherine Tweeddale suggested that she would like to see her progress braked down by topics, so she know later on which topics to concentrate on.
